This repository contains python scripts for training and testing [Deep Interaction Transformer (DIT)]

Deep Interaction Transformer (DIT) is a full Transformer framework for point cloud registration, which achieves superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art learning-based methods in accuracy and robustness. DIT consists of the following three main modules:

- a Point Cloud Structure Extractor for modeling global relation.
- a Point Feature Transformer for improving the discrimination of features.
- a GMCCE for correspondence confidence evaluation.

## Code coming soon
